# 🔑 How to Create GitHub Personal Access Token

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to GitHub Settings:**
   👉 https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. **Click "Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**

3. **Fill in:**
   - **Note:** "Crypto Raffle Push Access"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or your choice)
   - **Select scopes:** Check ✅ **repo** (this gives full repo access)

4. **Click "Generate token"** at the bottom

5. **Copy the token** (it looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Copy it now! You won't see it again!

6. **Paste it in the terminal** when asked for password

## Alternative: Use SSH Instead

If you prefer, we can switch to SSH authentication which doesn't need tokens.

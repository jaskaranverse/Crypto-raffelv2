## 🔄 Auto-Sync Workflow

### How It Works:

```
You make changes → I push to GitHub → Netlify auto-deploys → Live site updates (30-60s)
```

### Your Workflow:

1. **Tell me what to change**
   - "Change the prize to 1 ETH"
   - "Add a new raffle"
   - "Update the colors"

2. **I make the changes**
   - Edit the code
   - Test locally
   - Push to GitHub

3. **Netlify auto-deploys**
   - Detects GitHub push
   - Builds new version
   - Deploys automatically

4. **Live site updates**
   - Takes 30-60 seconds
   - No manual work needed
   - Everything synced!
